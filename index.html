                <p>Engineered Quartz are made from natural stone quartz, one of the hardest minerals on Earth, for superior durability and performance. Cambria, Caesarstone, Silestone, Vadara, LG Viatera and other brands, mimics the look and feel of Stone Granite/Marble, but has stronger and more structured bonding due to engineering and the benefit of it being an easy clean up.
